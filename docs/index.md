# Introduction

There is currently no centralised, unbiased, user-centred approach to providing comprehensive help for young people to explore and navigate their options (e.g. post-GCSE options, especially technical and apprenticeships).

There is an opportunity to create a single service that:

* empowers young people to FIND and explore all their education and training options
* helps those facing additional barriers
* assists parents, teachers and careers advisors to support these decisions


It improves on existing search tools, by:

* Bringing together all government funded education and training opportunities into a single, unified search.
* Making it easier for users to find what they are looking for, especially when they donâ€™t know what an education or training opportunity is called.
